There are already a couple of `official quick start
guides <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/manual/1.0/quick.html>`__ to
using Mercurialâ€™s Windowâ€™s client program
`TortoiseHG <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/>`__, but below are the
bare details of how to use it with a new account on the `BitBucket
service <http://geographika.co.uk/?p=584>`__.

1. Create a new account on http://bitbucket.org/. Then create a new
repository for your code.

2. Download the TortoiseHG program for Windows from
http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/. Install and reboot. This will add
context commands to Windows Explorer.

3. Right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer that contains the code
files or scripts you want to add to your BitBucket account, and select
â€œCreate Repository Hereâ€ from the context menu.

4. Next right-click in the folder and select â€œAdd Files.â€ You can now
check which files in the folder you wish to add to BitBucket, and click
the â€œAddâ€ button.

5. Right-click again in the folder and select â€œHg Commit.â€ The screen
below should appear. You can enter a text description for the update
(â€œadd tilecache scriptâ€ in the image below). Once youâ€™ve done this click
the â€œCommitâ€ button in the toolbar.

6. Right-click again in the folder and select â€œHg Repository Explorer.â€
Add the name of your BitBucket repository to the address bar as shown
below. In this case my repository is
http://bitbucket.org/geographika/mapserver-scripts â€" yours should be in
a similar format.

7. In the menu select â€œSynchronizeâ€ and then â€œPushâ€

8. You should be presented with a confirmation dialog as below. You will
be asked for your username and password for BitBucket (step 1). Thatâ€™s
it! You can then check your code online, and learn the rest at your own
pace! Let me know if youâ€™ve posted anything good in the comments below!

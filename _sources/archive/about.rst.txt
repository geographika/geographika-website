Who am I?
~~~~~~~~~

I'm an independent geodeveloper who designs, creates, and customises
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the web and desktop. Most of my
time is spent providing consulting and bespoke geospatial software
development to clients in Ireland and Europe.

What do I Use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Originally I started out writing custom add-ons to ESRI's ArcView 3.1
using
`Avenue <http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.gisDictionary.search&searchTerm=Avenue>`__.
I've since gone through all the upgrades to ArcGIS 9.3 using .NET via
`VBA <http://geographika.co.uk/7-reasons-for-esri-not-to-drop-vba>`__.

As most projects involve bespoke development to build on existing GIS
systems I've had to chance to work with most GIS packages including
`Geomedia <http://www.intergraph.com/sgi/products/productFamily.aspx?family=10&country=>`__,
`CadCorp <http://www.cadcorp.com/>`__, and `Oracle
Spatial <http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/spatial/index.html>`__.

My current favourite technologies are a mix of proprietary and
open-source technologies. I'm a big fan of `SQL Server
2008 <http://geographika.co.uk/category/sql-server-2008>`__, which has
spatial support. I often use
`MapServer <http://geographika.co.uk/category/mapserver>`__ for serving
out data via `web services <http://geographika.co.uk/category/wms>`__.
For web mapping I am currently using a mix of
`OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`__,
`GeoExt <http://www.geoext.org/>`__, and
`MapFish <http://geographika.co.uk/category/mapfish>`__. `

Why a Blog?
~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the main reasons for starting a blog was as a "work diary" - a
handy place to keep track of how exactly I did something, so I can refer
to it a year later when I've forgotten it. As a bonus, and incentive to
documenting what I've been up to, others may find a few useful tips, or
solutions to errors. Feel free to leave comments or questions on any of
the posts. If you require custom spatial software development then
please `get in touch <http://geographika.co.uk/contact-me>`__.

I can also be found on `Twitter <http://twitter.com/geographika>`__ and
`StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/users/179520/geographika>`__.

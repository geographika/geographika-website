Writing ArcObjects code and using an Access personal geodatabase will
result sooner or later in an error along the lines of "Cannot aquire a
schema lock because of an existing lock." Spending hours going through
code, making sure objects are disposed of and that all connections
closed often makes very little difference. It becomes apparent some of
the problems lie deeper than customised code when the same errors occur
when using ArcMap or ArcCatalog without any modifications.

I have been using `Unlocker <http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/>`__, a
freeware program, to solve these issuesÂ when developing with ArcObjects
(or just using ArcMap..). Once installed a simple right click on an ldb
or mdb file can remove any file locks, and your code is free to run
again. It works with any Windows file or folder so is a useful program
to have around even without geodatabases.

|image|\ There are already `Windows
packages <http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/>`__ available for MapServer
ready for deployment. However if you need to make a modification to the
source files, apply a patch, or just want to see how MapServer is made
then you can build MapServer from its C source files. Thanks to the
`ready made build kits <http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/>`__ this
process should only take 10-15 minutes from start to finish.

*Prerequisites: Microsoft Visual Studio with C++*

1. Download the MapServer SDK (Software Development Kit) from
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/. I‚Äôm using Visual Studio 2010, and
building on a 32-bit Windows machine (still using XP..), so I‚Äôm using
`release-1600-dev <http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1600-dev.zip>`__

These build kits, provided by one of MapServer‚Äôs developers `Tamas
Szekeres <http://szekerest.blogspot.com/>`__,¬† contain everything you
need to compile both MapServer and `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`__.
Checking out all the files from the `MapServer SVN
repository <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/browser>`__ is not enough,
as this does not contain the GDAL or RegEx dependencies (DLLs that
MapServer depends on), or SWIG ‚Ä" a tool used to create MapScript files
for each of the different scripting languages available in MapServer
such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl etc.

2. Unzip the MapServer SDK on your hard-drive. Make a cup of tea as this
takes awhile. In this example I‚Äôve extracted the files to D:\\MapServer.
You should see a folder structure similar to below.

3. Open up a WIndows command prompt. Navigate to the folder you
extracted the files. Now run the following command:

"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin\\vcvars32.bat"

This is a Windows batch file that sets up environment variables so you
can use the MS Visual Studio tools in your current command session.

If this file is not present then make sure you have Microsoft Visual
Studio C++ 2010 installed. You can check this in Add/Remove programs, or
through the About menu in Visual Studio. It is not installed by default
so you may have to go and find your installation disks or ISO.

4. The
`nmake <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd9y37ha%28v=VS.100%29.aspx>`__
tool is a Microsoft program that builds projects based on the contents
of a `Makefile <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29>`__.
It‚Äôs the command line equivalent of pressing F5 in Visual Studio. You
can look at the contents of the Makefile in a text editor ‚Ä" this is
where all the hard work is done. Run the following command:

nmake ms

Sit back and watch the compilation! If you want to record what happened
to a log file you can use the command:

nmake ms >> my\_log.txt

After this build there should be a new folder
D:\\MapServer\\release-1600\\ containing all the files you need to
deploy MapServer. When unzipped this folder already contained a build,
but the timestamps for the DLLS should now be from a few minutes ago.

Rebuilding MapScript
--------------------

The Makefile D:\\MapServer\\Makefile contains details on how to build
MapScript. The Makefile commands are great to follow if you want to just
rebuild Python MapScript rather than the whole of MapServer. Just search
for ‚Äúms-python‚Äù and you‚Äôll see all the DOS commands you need to rebuild
Python. You can then run these ‚Äúby-hand‚Äù as shown below.

My original build produced MapScript for Python 2.6, but I also wanted
to create a build for 2.7. To create a Python 2.7 compatible MapScript
follow these steps:

1. Open the D:\\MapServer\\mapserver-6-0\\mapscript\\python\\setup.py
file in a Python editor such as IDLE. Change the library\_dirs to read:

library\_dirs = ['../../','../../../release-1600/lib/']

|image|\ It should be possible to set these paths outside the setup.py
on the command line, but I was not able to get this to work. This change
adds in the folder containing all the .lib files that were created when
we built MapServer. Check these files are present!

2. Navigate to the D:\\MapServer\\mapserver-6-0\\mapscript\\python
directory.

3. Run the following commands (taken from the Makefile):

**SET DISTUTILS\_USE\_SDK=1
 SET MSSdk=1
 SET LIB=%LIB%;$D:\\MapServer\\release-1600\\lib**

4. Run the following command:

python.exe setup.py build

|image| You should now have two new files ‚Ä" mapscript.py and
\_mapscript.pyd (a .pyd file is a DLL `with a couple of
differences <http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll>`__).

Here be Errors
--------------

I took out all the twists, turns, and errors I encountered along the way
to make the process appear simple, and me to appear to be an
expert..however I ran into a myriad of problems, the error messages of
which I‚Äôve included below, along with how to fix them.

*'nmake' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
program or batch file.*

- Make sure you have run the "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio
10.0\\VC\\bin\\vcvars32.bat" file in your current Windows command
session.

*LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'gd.lib'
 error: command 'link.exe' failed with exit status 1181*

- You need to edit the setup.py file to include the folder with the .lib
files ‚Ä" see ‚ÄúRebuilding MapScript step 2.‚Äù Also make sure you have built
MapServer and the gd.lib file is in your
D:\\MapServer\\release-1600\\lib folder.

*building '\_mapscript' extension
 error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat*

- When building MapScript you need to set the correct environment
variables ‚Ä" see ‚ÄúRebuilding MapScript step 3‚Äù

*\_mapscript.pyd.manifest : general error c1010070: Failed to load and
parse the manifest. The system cannot* *find the file specified. error:
command 'mt.exe' failed with exit status 31*

- Try cleaning the Python MapScript build folders with the following
command:

**D:\\MapServer\\mapserver-6-0\\mapscript\\python>python.exe setup.py
clean**

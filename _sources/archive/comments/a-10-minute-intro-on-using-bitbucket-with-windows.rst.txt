How about an 8th:

8. VBA apps can be run without requiring an install. Many organization
limit what users can install on their computers yet rarely limit VBA.
While a .NET may not be allowed, a VBA is.

Indeed, but VBA is no longer being licensed by Microsoft to 3rd parties
(as of 2007), and all development has since stopped as well. There are
many security holes and issues with it, and I think ESRi is doing well
to phase it out. The 2+ years people have of warning about this should
be plenty for people to migrate to something else (Python with the new
functionality of 9.4?).

Do not take me wrong but:

| 1. You do not need to explicitly implement all the interface , there
are tools to do this.
|  2. A setup doesn't need to be "heavy" , in fact it is as lean as VBA.
|  3. I agree, if you don't need anything different to what a sample
provides it's ok to with it. As you stated it's easy for someone with no
programming experience.
|  4. I agree
|  5. I agree
|  6. I agree partially , if you were always to held the same position
this can help, I'm not sure about people out there, but since I have
moved a lot I do not rely on this knowledge to help/keep me a job.
|  7. I don't really get the point, I'm no native English speaker,but I
don't think anyone's recommending C# over Vb.Net,
|  this is just about deprecating VBA.
|  8. I don't know if that's possible
|  9. Yes that would be great, not sure if possible

| Just to let you now I started doing "Magik" (Smallworld)and afterward
VB6 ,I moved to PL/SQL and SQL, then Java, then C#,
|  then shell scripting (Solaris,Linux,AIX).This has always occurred
within GIS environments, there are some more GIS offerings besides ESRI
( though I currently work in an ESRI based project)

Do not rely in one language to do your day to day work, this can easily
change. Just get the roots and you'll be prepared for every language.

|  Hi Nico,

| Even with the tools to set up the interface, you still need to learn
Visual Studio, how to add in the ESRI tools to this, and then be
confronted with a whole load of pregenerated code which would look like
nonsense to any non-developer.
|  A set up could be very simple, but again it takes time and effort on
the developer's part to create custom installer classes and set up
packages.
|  I agree that a developer should not fear the death of VBA from
ArcGIS, but for advanced GIS users who are probably more numerous in
various civil service jobs, it removes the chance of automating daily
tasks themselves.

The dropping of support for VBA gives rise to a big question for what I
would call the "non-programmer GIS community". That is those of us who
have learned GIS and picked up a bit of VBA along the way (for
customisation, labelling expressions, field calculator expressions etc.)
without being fully-blown programmers.

That question is what should we use now?. Clearly VBA is on the way out,
and ESRI have given us a good head's up that support for it will be
dropped if we hadn't already figured that out from Microsoft's decision
not to continue development. Can Python do everything that VBA could do?
If not, should we channel our efforts in other directions?

Dave

| Dave, I completely agree. Can't we just go back to Avenue? :)
Seriously though, I am not a programmer and frankly I do not want to be
one. I get the feeling that the future of GIS will mean you have to know
programming languages. All these languages have a nasty habit of
becoming obsolete every few years.
|  The attitude of most programmers is
|  "Learn how to program and then programing for GIS will be easy."
|  thats like saying "Learn calculus for a job that only requires adding
fractions." I hope ESRI continues to be helpful in letting users share
code to keep it simple.

I am bummed. Mostly because I am foggy on ESRI's direction after this.
Looks like they are pretty tight with Microsoft now (Silverlight, etc),
so whatever way MS goes, ESRI will follow no doubt. Python is pretty
prevalent in ArcGIS, but as someone mentioned - not exactly hooked into
the interface and all that ArcObjects have to offer. If they develop an
API for Python that bridges the gap, then all is not lost. I have
several MXD-based VBA apps that will have to be updated (many planned
for .Net anyway), but the quick result macro functionality of VBA will
be missed. Yes, Avenue was a good analogy in seeing code work or not
work immediately without having to go into a compiling environment like
Studio. Perhaps 9.4 will be the last version many use for a long time
(even if on maintenance) like those still using Win 2K out there (as
discovered in James Fee blog), Some on 8.X, and probably even those
still using AV 3.2!

Hi all,

I'm somewhat perturbed by the future of VBA. I've written some very
large and successful projects entirely within the MXD and will be very
concerned about the demise of VBA, mainly because some clients I have
developed for have such a ridiculous IT policy that despite them asking
for a tool their IT department won't allow the installation of DLLs
which is what .Net creates. I cannot create an extension, a command
buton, or a GP function tool because they are all DLLs that you have to
install and don't get me on my soap box about administrative rights...

None of this is an issue with VBA. So I agree with the blog that if they
want VB .Net, fine but for God sake don't drop the ability to store code
and customisation within an MXD.

I really hope someone from ESRI is reading this...

| There is a replacement available for VBA in MXD now that stores VB.Net
in MXD.
|  Made possible by the ARIS .Net Scripting Tool for ArcMap:
|  http://www.aris.nl/dotnetscripting_arcmap

| Use VB.Net for prototyping, no need to open Visual Studio.
|  Store the VB.Net script in the MXD and build and run directly from
ArcMap.
|  No Visual Studio license required.

Why just don't continue to use older version of ArcGIS which support VBA
and all stuff writen on it for old projects? Not only ESRI refuse from
VBA, Autodesk, for example did the same thing. Microsoft stoped
supporting VBA and others did the same. But this tool (I mean VBA) is
very good to refuse from it. Understand that newer versions of softwsre
have some advantages, but for most users they are not so important. For
example our company stoped at AutoCAD 2007, MS Office 2003 and ArcGIS
9.1 and uses them all with VBA.

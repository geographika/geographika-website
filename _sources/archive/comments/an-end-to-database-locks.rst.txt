Hi. This is a very nice idea. How would you go about extending this to
all the other tools: get feat info? or printing? also, wms get map is
routed through the proxy when you config one in OpenLayers. Would this
work? (I couldn't see the map in your example)

Hi Duarte,

The use case I needed the above code for was for a simple mapping page
that needed to add in WMS layers from any remote server.

It was to install on IIS / Windows, so setting up a Python CGI proxy
seemed overkill, and also I'd have to whitelist all sites.

Its not going to replace all the features of a proxy (though it would be
nice to have a plugin that used YQL through Openlayer.Proxyhost), but
simplifies some setups.

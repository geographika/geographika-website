I am using SIS to automate stuff here in Japan. My company, or rather my
division, nearly lives entirely off programming for the SIS API.

I only just started and find it a bit of a nightmare because the API is
really unintuitive and the documentation is minimal to say the least (I
rely on the online documentation though...). And the thing with having
to work with named lists is a big pain in the backside as you say!

One thing about the FindOverlayByName() function you posted above. I
have been using this method too, primarily because it was in the code I
inherited. I just realised today that this function will break if any
one of your overlays has an index greater than the number of indices...
Can you think of any way to overcome this?

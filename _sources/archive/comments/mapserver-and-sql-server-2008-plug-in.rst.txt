Hi,

Glad that you were able to get the fixes for the issues encountered. One
quick comment about the error and it fixe in MI Pro 10.0.1 maintenance
release. In the release notes, while one can argue that the description
might not be very explicit on the error and its message, here is the
reference to the issue (in the release notes):

| "
|  C15797 When ArcGISÂ® 9.2 or 9.3 is installed on the machine MapInfo
Professional closes unexpectedly when
|  opening a Universal Data File.
|  Resolution: Issue is resolved.
|  "

|  Thanks for taking the time to read the post and reply. Just looked
through the release notes, and the issue is right at the top of the
list.
|  There's nothing on Google about the error (until this post!), so it
was hard to narrow down the issue.
|  The SQL Server data seems to be working perfectly so far (including
editing), and its nice to see MapInfo take an interest in their users.

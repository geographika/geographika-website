It can be frustrating when a code sample that seems to do exactly what
you want is written in C#, and your application is in
VB.Net. \ http://www.kamalpatel.net/ConvertCSharp2VB.aspx solves this
problem by converting the C# code directly into its VB.Net equivalent -
all online and for free for code up to 6.15KB in size, and for larger
amounts of code a tool can be downloaded for free.

It does the majority of the conversion well but I ran into a few minor
problems where line breaks were not taken into account.

This tool will be even more useful when the ESRI samples, the majority
of which are only available in VB6, are updated to .NET...

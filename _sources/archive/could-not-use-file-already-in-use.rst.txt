Access, lock files,Â and Visual Source Safe - an accident waiting to
happen! I got the above error, after my code had been fine for weeks.
Googling turned up permissions on the folder with the Access database,
and closing secondary applications. The solution in the end turned out
to be that the .ldb file had come under source control. Removing it from
this, and deleting the fle resolved the issue.

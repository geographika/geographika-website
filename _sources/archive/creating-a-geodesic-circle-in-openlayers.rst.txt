I recently asked a question on `GIS Stack
Exchange <http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3264/using-geodesic-measurements-for-cirle-radii>`__
on how to create a buffer around a point that took into account the
curvature of the earth. OpenLayers has support for `geodesic
measurements <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic>`__, but not
creating geodesic polygons. Drawing a standard polygon on a Mercator
projected map can produce features with very different measurements from
their intended "on the ground" equivalents.

`Paul Ramsey <http://www.cleverelephant.ca/>`__ pointed out that *“the
scale errors for Mercator are very high indeed (infinite, in fact, at
the poles) increasing as you head north/south from the true scale
latitude.”* In fact drawing a circle (in Ireland - 53 degrees North)
with a 10km geometric radius produced a circle with an on the ground
radius of 6km. A huge margin of error over a very short distance (see a
`previous
post <http://geographika.co.uk/watch-out-for-openlayer-distances>`__ on
the same subject).

After a useful answer from `Dan Shoutis <http://blog.shoutis.org/>`__,
it appeared most of the work to implement geodesic circles was already
available in the OpenLayers API. The `OpenLayers’ geodesic
functions <http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/browser/trunk/openlayers/lib/OpenLayers/Util.js>`__
are based on code adapted from Chris Veness work at
http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty-direct.html.

The code to create a regular (non-geodesic) polygon can be seen in the
OpenLayers source
`here <http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/browser/trunk/openlayers/lib/OpenLayers/Geometry/Polygon.js>`__.
There is a function added after the class
OpenLayers.Geometry.Polygon.createRegularPolygon that can be used to
*“create a regular polygon around a radius. Useful for creating circles
and the like.”*

This function only required a couple of changes - notably using
Longitude and Latitude and rather than X and Ys, to produce geodesic
polygons. If you are using the Mercator projection then transformations
requires `proj4js <http://proj4js.org/>`__ support.

An online demo of the function is available at
http://geographika.co.uk/samples/geodesic/. The adapted function can be
seen at http://geographika.co.uk/samples/geodesic/GeodesicPolygon.js.

I have uploaded the full source code for the demo to
http://bitbucket.org/geographika/openlayers/src.

Just don’t try drawing circles around the map edges..

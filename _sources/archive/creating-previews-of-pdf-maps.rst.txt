|image|\ The `MapFish print module <http://geographika.co.uk/?p=727>`__
used by both MapFish and GeoExt generates PDF maps that can be saved to
clients machines. Over time you can acquire hundreds of different PDFs,
but unfortunately Windows XP does not generate thumbnail previews to
help find them again later.

The script below solves this problem by generating a PNG image of all
the PDFs in a folder. The image to the left shows the results of the
script when run on a series of `UN Mission
Maps <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>`__.

This relies on two programs to be installed.
`ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows>`__
â€" a free image conversion software package, and
`GhostScript <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/files/GPL%20Ghostscript/>`__
another free program that can be used to access, read, and create PDF
files. You may have to reboot your machine after installing these
programs for the script to run successfully.

The script uses a
`convert <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php>`__ utility
program which comes with ImageMagick.

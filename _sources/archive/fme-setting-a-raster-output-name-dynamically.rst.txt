I have started to use `FME <http://www.safe.com/>`__ more and more for
data imports and data processing. I like automating any workflow as much
as possible, and FME is great for this. For one part of a project had a
number of similar raster processes that could be defined in a single
workspace, as long as parameters could be used.

The system documentation is normally both detailed and clear, and FME
also has very good `support and community web
sites <http://www.safe.com/fmeusercentral/index.php>`__.Â  However in
this case it took a lot of documentation reading and trial and error to
work out how to change the ouput filename of a model. This may be
obvious to experienced users of FME, but it had me stumped for a while.

The steps involved are simple in retrospect, and are as follows:

Create your raster model as normal, but add an additional
**AttributeSetter** transformer, as shown in the screenshot above.

Next create a new **Published Parameter** that will be used to pass in
the output raster filename. The source dataset and destination folder
can also be set to be published parameters to provide full flexibility.

Next right click on the newly created published parameter and check the
AttributeSetter value item. This creates the link between the parameter
and the value for the attribute.

If you look at the AttributeSetter's properties they should now look
similar to below.

Finally look at the properties for your output raster dataset. Make sure
the "Fanout By Attribute" is checked and the attribute is set to
fme\_basename. This sets the output filename to be the same as the
fme\_basename attribute value, which is now set via an input parameter.

The model is now ready to run from the command line or through a batch
process, for one or many raster transformations. The output filename
parameter does not require a .tif extension.

              --SourceDataset_ARCVIEWGRID C:\Grids
              --DestDataset_GEOTIFF C:\Rasters
              --OutputFileName MyOutputRaster

Most of the major GIS software vendors now have a free introductory
"viewer" available for download. These normally contain standard
navigation and selection tools, and allow you to view datasets but not
change them.

They are very useful if a company is about to invest in a GIS and are
unsure what software to use. Point their employees to the following
links, create a few datasets relevant to their organisation, and let
them get a feel for each and find out their preferences. Clearly it will
be the management who will make the investment so there will be a
trade-off between cost and how much their employees like a particular
product.

Of course you could always just recommend whichever one you feel most
comfortable developing in..\ |devil|

I've recently been working again with Intergraph's Geomedia WebMap 5.2.
Development can be done in .NET, which seemed very advanced a few years
ago when ESRI's flagship product was ArcIMS..

However it seems that line features can only be rendered as solid lines
(no dots or dashes)..a very strange oversight, especially when it
appears the outlines of polygons *can* have linear styling!

I'm going to be installing version 6 soon to see if it has been
resolved, and see if there are any new features.

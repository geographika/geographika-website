recently had a small project that required vector features in several
thousand `Global Mapper <http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/global-mapper/>`__
project files to be extracted into shapefiles.

The batch export tool didn't seem to be running on the project files, so
I was asked to take a look at the Global Mapper
`scripting <http://www.globalmapper.com/helpv13/ScriptReference.html>`__
documentation. The syntax was easy to follow, and scripts can be run by
passing the script file name as an argument on the command line to the
Global Mapper .exe file.

However when looking at the attributes of some of the exported
shapefiles in ArcCatalog, the table was blank. Upon further
investigation a couple of interesting issues came to light.

1. The shapefile string fields created by the Global Mapper export had a
maximum length of 255 characters. I compared this to a newly created
ESRI shapefile, and the DBFs string fields in this only had a maximum
length of 254 characters. This difference also crashed the ESRI
`Merge <http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//001700000055000000>`__
tool (with no meaningful explanation). I had to cut the last character
off in Python before they would merge.

2. Field names were not cleaned up by the GM export, meaning punctuation
and spaces led to corrupt shapefiles/DBFs. I was able to get around this
by editing the field names in the GM project files prior to an export,
using the following syntax:

.. code:: bat

     EDIT_VECTOR ATTR_TO_RENAME="FIELD. NAME.=FIELD_NAME"

The `ESRI Shapefile
Specification <http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf>`__
states that:

    *"The dBASE file (.dbf) contains any desired feature attributes or
    attribute keys to which other tables can be joined. Its format is a
    standard DBF file used by many table-based applications in Windows
    and DOS. "*

However the "standard" `DBF
Specification <http://www.dbase.com/knowledgebase/int/db7_file_fmt.htm>`__
simply mentions field names as being stored as ASCII text. It makes no
mention of any invalid characters, and no mention of 254 character field
limitations. Opening the DBFs in Excel didn't cause any issues.

I sent an email to Global Mapper support mentioning these issues, and
literally within hours I received the following reply:

    *"I updated the maximum field length for DBF export to 254 since
    ESRI can't handle the full 255 characters that the DBF format itself
    supports. I also limited the field names to just characters,
    numbers, and underscore since it appears that ESRI also can't handle
    just anything in the DBF field names despite the DBF format itself
    having no such limits. "*

    *"I have placed a new build at
    http://www.globalmapper.com/global\_mapper13.zip with the latest
    changes for you to try. Simply download that file and extract the
    contents into your existing v13.xx installation folder to give it a
    try. If you are using the 64-bit v13 version there is a new build at
    http://www.globalmapper.com/global\_mapper13\_64bit.zip ."*

I was stunned to get not only a reply from email technical support that
not only understood the issue I reported, but had updated, fixed, and
recompiled the executable, and made it available for
`download <http://www.globalmapper.com/global_mapper13.zip>`__ (all by
the principle developer Mike Childs). Although I've not used Global
Mapper enough (beyond scripting) to judge it as a GIS application, I can
certainly vouch for the *"unsurpassed technical support with no extra
support fees"* mentioned on their site.

In addition there are plans to allow to export to the slightly superior
(in that memo fields can be handled without resorting to additional
files) ESRI File Geodatabase format:

    *"While there is currently only support for reading and not writing
    ESRI File Geodatabases, we are planning on adding ESRI File
    Geodatabase export support, perhaps as soon as the upcoming v14
    release later this year. "*

The next post will be written by `Adrià
Mercader <http://amercader.net/>`__ who has been working on configuring
the MapFish print server to be used on IIS. This fits in perfectly with
the recent Window / open source hybrid web-mapping solutions I have been
working on.

Adrià is also the author of the `WMS
Inspector <https://github.com/amercader/WMS-Inspector/wiki/>`__ a
FireFox plug-in that allows you to view and analyse WMS requests for a
web-page. This was recently presented at `FOSS4G in
Barcelona <http://2010.foss4g.org/presentations_show.php?id=2999>`__,
near Adrià’s hometown. He has recently moved to Newcastle in the UK,
clearly for both better weather and football.

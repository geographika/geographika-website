`|image|\ Linear
referencing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Reference_System>`__ is
used to define features in relation to existing line features. These new
features can either be points or lines. For example a water monitoring
station can be defined as 300m along a section of river, or a stretch of
road can be defined as requiring repairs, from 220m along to 270m along.
Most GISs implement this functionality - for details look at the
`ESRI <http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=An_overview_of_linear_referencing>`__
and
`GRASS <http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/html64_user/lrs.html>`__
help pages.

In terms of storing linear referenced point features, you only need
three fields ‚Ä" an ID of the original line feature, an ID of the¬† feature
to reference along the line, and a M value ‚Ä" the measurement along the
original feature. Line features require two measurement fields, a
starting distance, and an end distance.

Dynamic Segmentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linear referenced features can be stored in a standard table structure.
What is more complicated however is displaying these features again ‚Ä" a
process (termed, at least by ESRI) as dynamic segmentation ‚Ä" the process
of dynamically splitting, or segmenting, an existing feature. It‚Äôs a
step up from a standard table join, but essentially has the same purpose
of relating two records in a database.

`SQL Spatial Tools <http://sqlspatialtools.codeplex.com/>`__ is an open
source collection of functions to manipulate spatial data within SQL
Server 2008. It contains a¬† LocateAlongGeom function that ‚Äú\ *takes a
geometry linestring and finds the point a given distance along it.‚Äù* So
that takes care of displaying linear referenced points. What it lacks at
the moment (and can be found in other spatial databases such as
`PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-svn/reference.html#Linear_Referencing>`__
and
`Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technology/sample_code/products/spatial/htdocs/lrs_sample/lrs_example_readme.htm>`__),
is a way to dynamically create line features using a distance from and a
distance to. Fortunately the SQL datatypes and existing spatial tool
functions make this easy to add in.

The Code
~~~~~~~~

The CreateLinearReferenceFeature code can be seen in the `Function.cs
file <https://bitbucket.org/geographika/sql-server-spatial-tools/src/tip/Functions.cs>`__.
The full project is available for download and modifications in
BitBucket at https://bitbucket.org/geographika/sql-server-spatial-tools.
As I‚Äôm never sure if CodePlex accepts patches or not, I decided to
create my own fork of the code. I have uploaded the `key files to
CodePlex <http://sqlspatialtools.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/patches>`__
where they will await evaluation. I‚Äôd imagine however that there will be
a new release of the tools by Microsoft for the new `Denali
release <http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/product-info/future-editions.aspx>`__
of SQL Server 2008, so this funciton may have to be merged into a new
release in the future.

The SQL Spatial Tools compile to a DLL, and the assembly needs to be
registered with the database along with all the associated functions. I
modified the `original SQL
script <http://sqlspatialtools.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/61525#255008>`__
to include the `new
functions <https://bitbucket.org/geographika/sql-server-spatial-tools/src/tip/SQL%20Scripts/Register.sql>`__.¬†
There is also an¬†
`unregister.sql <https://bitbucket.org/geographika/sql-server-spatial-tools/src/9fa85d45d386/SQL%20Scripts/Unregister.sql>`__
script to remove the assembly and functions. A few caveats on the linear
refence function:

-  the code has not been tested on the new `SQL Server 2008 curve
   type <http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/BOBB/post/New-curve-types-in-SQL-Server-Denali-are-now-in-OGC-spec.aspx>`__
-  the project is written in C# and compiled with Visual Studio 2010
-  if you give the function a MeasureTo value greater than the length of
   the feature you will receive the following System.ArgumentException:
   ‚Äú\ *MeasureTo value must be less than the length of the feature.* ‚Äù

To test out the functionality you can use the SQL script below. Feedback
and comments appreciated!And no need to store hundreds of little line
geometries in the same database as your nice clean line networks.

|image|\ I take it as given that anyone developing with Firefox and
`OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`__ has
`Firebug <http://getfirebug.com/>`__ installed. Firebug has a number of
powerful tools that can make the previous nightmare of JavaScript
debugging tolerable.

One feature I recently ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù are the logging options. It's
definitely a timesaver over my previous method of putting temporary
alert(vals); throughout my code. As well as debugging the logging is
very useful for `automatically
documenting <../category/documentation>`__ formulae in JavaScript with
worked examples that can then be pasted straight into the documentation.

An example of the logging capabilities can be seen on my sample
`OpenLayers page <http://geographika.co.uk/samples/ol_debug.html>`__. If
you already have Firebug installed you should be able to see the output
similar to that below when the page loads.

Console.log
~~~~~~~~~~~

The full range of options for logging can be seen in the Firebug
`Console API wiki
page <http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API>`__. The `sample
page <http://geographika.co.uk/samples/ol_debug.html>`__ has a few
different logging options briefly explained below.

To list all properties and functions for the `layer
object <http://dev.openlayers.org/apidocs/files/OpenLayers/Layer-js.html>`__
simply add:

::

    console.dir(layer);

To list only an objects properties (without all its associated
functions), use a construct similar to:

::

    //an alternative to just list properties
    var prop;
    for (prop in layer) {
    ¬†¬† if (typeof layer[prop] !== 'function') {
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† console.log('%s : %s', prop, layer[prop]); //log values to Firebug
    ¬†¬† }
    }

This example below prints details about the `map
object <http://dev.openlayers.org/apidocs/files/OpenLayers/Map-js.html>`__.
Handily Firebug adds a hyperlink in the output to the line where
console.info is called. String substitutions can be used (e.g. replace
%s with a string, or %i with an integer) for easier formatting.

::

    // write out some info
    console.info("The map projection is %s and has %i layers", map.projection, map.layers.length);
    console.info('Layer Name: \'%s\'', layer.name);

Assertions can be placed in code as follows:

::

    // make an assertion
    console.assert(map.layers.length === 1);

I was taught to use the `assert
statement <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_%28computing%29>`__ as
often as possible in code. Its amazing (and disconcerting) how many
times ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù situations can occur. Whilst assertions are normally
removed from production code for desktop applications, a JavaScript
error message may prove invaluable when trying to debug a user‚Äôs problem
remotely. As with everything in programming its a personal choice
whether or not to use assertions ‚Ä" some people clearly `assertions are
evil <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1854302/is-assert-evil>`__.

The console API also supports timers, and writing out the call stack at
points in your application for when things start getting more
complicated.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `This
   function <http://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/branches/firebug1.6/lite/firebugx.js>`__
   makes sure that no JavaScript errors are thrown for browsers without
   Firebug installed. It is included in the sample.
-  Sometimes you may have to restart your browser, or make sure there is
   only one instance of Firefox is running for the logging messages to
   appear.
-  Internet Explorer 8 has similar development tools that can be
   downloaded from the `Microsoft
   site <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565628%28VS.85%29.aspx>`__.
   It appears to support similar `logging
   functions <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565625%28v=VS.85%29.aspx>`__
   as Firebug, but I‚Äôve not gone into these in any depth.

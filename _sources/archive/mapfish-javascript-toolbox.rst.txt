|image0|\ Mapfish is an open-source web mapping framework built using
the `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com/>`__ Python web framework for
*"creating web services that allow querying and editing of geographic
objects."* However the server-side functionality of the system I am
currently working on is already handled by SQL Server 2008 Spatial and
MapServer. What interested me more was that Mapfish *"provides a
complete RIA-oriented (Rich Internet Application) JavaScript toolbox."*

A couple of examples of the front-end interface can be found at the `EU
Inspire
Geoportal <http://www.inspire-geoportal.eu/index.cfm/pageid/341>`__, and
the `Marbled Murrelet Mashup <http://mamu.littleearth.ca/>`__. The
Mapfish client combines three frameworks into one
`OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`__,
`GeoExt <http://geoext.org/>`__, and `ExtJS <http://www.extjs.com/>`__.

The client JavaScript is available via downloaded from
http://www.mapfish.org/downloads/. At the time of writing
`mapfish-client-1.2.tar.gz <http://www.mapfish.org/downloads/mapfish-client-1.2.tar.gz>`__
was the most recent version. The files can be unzipped using the
open-source program `7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`__ that handles both
gzip and "tar ball" zip files. Once unzipped there are a number of
samples that can be run and edited locally (look for the
examples/map/index.html page). This alone is a huge step forward in
creating a basic online mapping system that rivals proprietary
offerings.

Further details on using the toolkit can be found at the `Mapfish
tutorial <http://www.mapfish.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/introduction.html?highlight=demo#mapfish-client>`__
and `this blog
tutorial <http://www.source3.com/mgiswiki/tiki-index.php?page=Customizing+the+sample+map>`__.
I'll also be writing some more technical posts, specifically around
using Mapfish with Windows, as most of the current documentation assumes
people are running Linux.

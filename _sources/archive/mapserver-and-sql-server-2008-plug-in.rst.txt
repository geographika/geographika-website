The `SQL Server 2008 plugin for
MapServer <http://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-38.html#usage-details>`__\ is
a *"native driver modeled on the PostGIS driver to*
|mapserver|\ *support SQL Server* *2008’s newly added spatial
capabilities."* It works fine for displaying data as WMS layers in
`OpenLayer <http://openlayers.org/>`__\ `s <http://openlayers.org/>`__
however I ran into all sorts of problems when trying to use the
GetFeatureInfo WMS query.

With MapServer 5.2.1  (installed using MapServer for Windows - `MS4W
v2.3.1 <http://maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml?page=downloads.html>`__) no
error message was returned, however neither was any data . I initially
thought this was due to the `following
bug <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/3082>`__ in the plugin,
which was `reported to have been fixed for MapServer
5.4 <http://n2.nabble.com/ms-sql-2008-spatial-still-problems-td1973412.html>`__.

So I tried downloading MS4W v3.0 Beta 7, which included MapServer 5.4,
and upgraded my installation. The WMS queries still failed but at least
this time I got an error message:

::

    msMSSQL2008LayerGetShape(): Query error. Error executing MSSQL2008 SQL statement:
    SELECT convert(varchar(20), FID) from SEI_MyTable WHERE
    GEOM.STIntersects(Geometry::STGeomFromText(&#39;POLYGON((343410.447904052 262585.540545139,
    343410.447904052 262585.540545139,343410.447904052 262585.540545139,343410.447904052
    262585.540545139,343410.447904052 262585.540545139))&#39;,0)) = 1

    -[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user-defined routine or aggregate &quot;geometry&quot;:
    System.FormatException: 24305: The Polygon input is not valid because the ring does not have enough distinct points. Each ring of a polygon must contain at least three distinct points.
    System.FormatException:

     at Microsoft.SqlServer.Types.SqlGeometry.GeometryFromText(OpenGisType type, SqlChars text, Int32 srid)

It appears that no matter what values I passed into my bounding box
parameter, a spatial query was made using a bounding box / polygon
consisting of 4 identical points, hence the error from SQL Server. I
tried a bounding box set to the full extent of my data but still no luck
- the bbox values made no different at all.

`This useful site <http://vbkto.dyndns.org:1280/sdk/Default.aspx>`__
automatically compiles the most recent MapServer versions into binaries
available or download, however the most recent versions of the plug-in
still fail.

I found `a post that had a similar
issue <http://www.mail-archive.com/mapserver-users@lists.osgeo.org/msg09024.html>`__
using CGI scripts rather than WMS calls. `A
suggestion <http://www.mail-archive.com/mapserver-users@lists.osgeo.org/msg08395.html>`__
was to use the
`TOLERANCE <http://mapserver.org/mapfile/layer.html#tolerance>`__
parameter for a layer, to increase the bounding box size, however this
makes no difference to a WMS GetFeatureInfo query.

The MapServer 5.4 sourcecode for the plugin can be `seen
here <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/browser/branches/branch-5-4/mapserver/mapmssql2008.c?rev=9245>`__,
however it is in C..and I can't seem to find where the rectangle object
is passed in or created. It appears Tamas Szekeres has taken over
updates to this plugin so I'll try and contact him to make him aware of
this issue. I'm not sure how many people actually use SQL Server 2008
and MapServer, but there is `at least one other
person <http://www.mail-archive.com/mapserver-users@lists.osgeo.org/msg04552.html>`__!

**Update (March 2010):** It appears this issue has now been fixed
for\ `version 5.6 by Tamas
Szekeres <http://szekerest.blogspot.com/2010/03/changes-in-mapserver-mssql2008-driver.html>`__.

    - Changed the query shape to POINT instead of POLYGON when the area
    of the query shape is zero (causing a failure at the server).

More details on the issue can be found in the `MapServer-dev mailing
list <http://n2.nabble.com/Getfeatureinfo-and-MSsql-2008-server-td4631781.html>`__.

|image0|\ I developed my MapServer application on Windows 2003 (a
virtual 64 bit server running), using MS4W (MapServer for Windows), and
had set up TileCache, and some Python scripts to `run through
Apache <http://geographika.co.uk/running-python-through-apache>`__. I
had managed to crash the set up numerous times in development, but I
hadn't come across any errors not of my own making.

The installation went well on the production server which was also a 64
bit machine, but was using Windows Server 2008. The site had an
unpublicised release as it is still in beta, and from this was getting
about 60 - 70 visitors a day.

I use `host-tracker.com <http://host-tracker.com/>`__ - a web site
monitoring service which lets me know if a site is down, and I was soon
made aware that it was.. There were no responses at all coming from
Apache, even though the Apache service was still running. Not even HTML
pages were returned. Restarting Apache returned the service to normal,
but this was happening every other day.

The Windows Error Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Windows Event Log had lots of the following errors:

::

    Faulting application name: mapserv.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x4935ad86
    Faulting module name: MSVCR71.dll, version: 7.10.3052.4, time stamp: 0x3e561eac
    Exception code: 0xc0000005Faulting process id: 0xe08
    Faulting application start time: 0x01caa0e28e6dcbb6
    Faulting application path: C:\ms4w\Apache\cgi-bin\mapserv.exe
    Faulting module path: C:\ms4w\Apache\cgi-bin\MSVCR71.dll
    Report Id: 4bc3555e-0cd7-11df-9e56-00155d002601

The MSVCR71 refers to the Microsoft C run-time libraries, so I \*think\*
the errors are likely to be from a program that uses them (ie.
MapServer) rather than the DLL itself. Windows 2003 has this DLL in its
system32 folder, whereas Windows 2008 does not, but as long as it is in
the application directory (cgi-bin in MapServer's case) then it should
not be a problem. In short I don't believe this DLL was the root of the
problem. I tried turning on MapServer debugging, but there were no
errors reported from MapServer itself.

The Apache Error Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the other hand the Apache log (C:\\ms4w\\Apache\\logs\\error.log) had
several warnings such as the following:

::

    [Thu Jan 28 15:37:15 2010] [warn] (OS 64)The specified network name is no longer available. :
    winnt_accept: Asynchronous AcceptEx failed.

The Apache documentation suggests that a possible cause of these errors
is due to *"virus scanning or virtual private network packages, have
bugs that interfere with the proper operation of AcceptEx()."* While I
could rule the first out, the second was a definite possibility as I was
required to use Juniper's
`NetScreenRemote <http://www.nscreensales.com/NetScreen_Remote_s/10.htm>`__
to connect to the server. The Juniper site now states *"No Longer
Available. Use Standards based IPSec client."*

I've had horrible problems with this software before, including no
longer being able to connect to wi-fi networks (repairing IPSEC was the
eventually solution), and corrupting a Cisco VPN client. The 0.5 star
`review on
CNET <http://reviews.cnet.com/remote-access/netscreen-remote-vpn-client/4505-3540_7-30340681.html>`__
show I am not alone in this opinion.

I tried using the
`Win32DisableAcceptEx <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mpm_winnt.html>`__
directive to try and stop these errors and hopefully resolve the Apache
crashes. Apache runs in 32 bit mode, so hopefully the 64 bit server
wouldn't mind..In C:\\ms4w\\Apache\\conf\\httpd.conf add the following
line, and restart the Apache service:

::

    Win32DisableAcceptEx

Final Outcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately although the Apache changes stopped the errors it didn't
stop the crashing. In the end I had to set up MapServer with IIS and the
site has been working fine ever since. As a bonus I was also able to use
the 64 bit versions of MapServer.

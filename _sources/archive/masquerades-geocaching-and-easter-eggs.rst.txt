|Masquerade|\ Thirty years ago `Kitt
Williams <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Williams>`__ wrote, or rather
painted, the children’s book 
`Masquerade <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080523747X?ie=UTF8&tag=geographika-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=080523747X>`__.
Each page had a picture that contained hidden clues pointing to the
location of an 18-carat gold, `jewel-encrusted
hare <http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/aug/20/kit-williams-golden-hare-masquerade>`__
buried somewhere in Britain. It sparked a National treasure hunt and
sold 2 million copies.

I remember being fascinated with the pictures and the theories and
solutions bandied about by those older and wiser than I. The majority of
programmers seem to have a fondness for puzzles and riddles, and the
beauty and success of the book was that it involved transposing clues to
maps and real-world locations.

Geocaching
~~~~~~~~~~

Geocaching could be seen as a successor to Williams’s book.  As someone
working in technology and geography it should seemingly be an ideal
pastime. However the fact geocaching is a `trademarked
word <http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4010:sfj3s6.2.1>`__
owned by a company named `Groundspeak <http://www.groundspeak.com/>`__
kills a little of the mystique. Secondly it appears to me to be the
equivalent of driving around in the middle of nowhere with a bad in-car
GPS trying to find an address that’s missing from the database.

I wouldn’t go as far as police Inspector Tyrus Cameron who `mistook a
geocache for a
bomb <http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=c7628126-a0f6-4a9e-a396-a40fa1948eab>`__
and was quoted as saying:

    *“They can have their fun, but we can’t be responding in this
    nature, or it’s a huge issue for the citizens of the city.”*

But it does seems to be a mechanical process with little puzzle-solving
involved. As I’ve never tried it my opinion clearly counts for little,
and I’m open to persuasion.

Easter Eggs
~~~~~~~~~~~

In keeping with the theme of buried secrets and Easter, I’m wondering if
the programmer tradition of inserting `Easter
Eggs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29>`__ into
software is now extinct. Microsoft have hidden many `eggs over the
years <http://content.techrepublic.com.com/2346-10877_11-161976.html>`__,
but now officially ban the practice to calm corporate security concerns.
And where Microsoft lead, desktop GIS will undoubtedly follow.

Previously typing `Jerry in
ArcMap <http://www.eggheaven.com/eggs/software/1257-arcmap>`__ version
8.x would pop up an image of `the man
himself <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia>`__. This has been
“fixed” from version 9.1 on as it seemingly caused `issues for several
users <http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&f=982&t=62574>`__ while
editing.

Google Maps has `a few Easter
Eggs <http://www.eeggs.com/tree/11263.html>`__, and this year the
`Australian site <http://maps.google.com.au/>`__ gave directions and
toll information in Aussie dialect for `April Fool’s
Day <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day>`__ - “\ *Ya might
have to cough up some cash along here.*\ ” Due to the nature of web
applications, and Google’s now familiar quirky approach, they aren’t as
as much of a thrill to find as a mode staid GIS application.
`FME <http://www.safe.com/>`__ have the `odd
one-liner <http://geographika.co.uk/baking-donuts>`__ in their
geo-processing output, and hopefully there are still a few treasures to
be found, and a few treasures to place.

Riddle Me This
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   <div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: justify;">

|The hare dreamt of parallax scrolling..|
    Even in 1984 this game only got 3/10

.. raw:: html

   </div>

On my trip down memory lane I found a
`riddle <http://www.bunnyears.net/kitwilliams/faq.html>`__. A copy of
`Hareraiser <http://www.bunnyears.net/kitwilliams/Hareraiser_All_Spectrum.zip>`__
(and `Spectrum
emulator <http://www.worldofspectrum.org/emulators.html>`__) for the
answer.

    *There came four men from out the wood
     Their way was straight and their strength was good
     Then over a bridge the four men ran
     To come together as one man
     There came a horse without a bone
     That made the four men whine and moan
     Wood and men and bridge are all but one
     Put them together and you'll find my riddle is undone.*

With the arrival of MS Access as the "personal" (i.e. restricted...)
geodatabase of choice, I along with many others have had to get familiar
with using SQL and Access. The graphical query generator (I am currently
using MS Access 2002) seems to like to make the statements as verbose as
possible, even thoigh relatively simple SQL still runs. Anyway below are
some of my often used queries.

-  To copy data from one table to another (where both fields in both
   tables match). This is useful when two identical datasets cover two
   different geographical areas but need to be combined into a larger
   datasets.

    | INSERT INTO Table1( Field1, Field2)
    |  SELECT Field1, Field2
    |  FROM Table2;

-  To create a new field in a table using a SQL statement (useful if you
   have to update many tables).

    ALTER TABLE Table1 ADD COLUMN MyStringField STRING;

-  To combine the results of two queries with the same fields (the top
   15 values from one subquery, and a specific record from another).

    | SELECT TOP 15 Field1, Field2
    |  FROM Subquery1
    |  UNION
    |  SELECT Field1, Field2
    |  FROM Subquery2
    |  WHERE Field1 = 272;

    More to follow (they get harder to explain!)...

|image| OGR, created by `Frank
Warmerdam <http://home.gdal.org/warmerda/>`__, is an open source library
and set of command line utilities for reading and writing geospatial
vector data using many different
formatsÂ \ ` <http://home.gdal.org/warmerda/>`__. It is the vector
equivalent of `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`__ which has similar
functionality for rasters.

The name of the library is a vestige from when OGR used to stand for
OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation. However as OGR is not
fully compliant with the `OpenGIS Simple Feature
specification <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa>`__ the name
was changed to OGR Simple Features Library (from the `GDAL
FAQ <http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FAQGeneral>`__).

The latest additions to the OGR formats are the SQL Server 2008
`geometry and
geography <http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/spatial-data.aspx>`__.
This enables spatial data in SQL Server 2008 to be reprojected, and
converted to other formats (shapefiles, MapInfo, KML, GML, GeoJSON and
any of the `many other formats already supported by
OGR <http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html>`__) using freely
available open source tools. Details on the associated OGR tools can be
seen `here <http://www.gdal.org/ogr_utilities.html>`__.

**The full MSSQLSpatial OGR driver notes and details are** `**available
online** <http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_mssqlspatial.html>`__\ **.**

Where can I get the Driver?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code for the new MSSQLSpatial driver can be seen here in the
online GDAL subversion `code
repository <http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/mssqlspatial>`__.
As can be seen by the check-in dates much of the work has been completed
in the last two weeks.

The two developers who deserve the credit are Tamas Szekeres and Even
Rouault, both members of the GDAL Project Management Committee. Tamas
has blogged about the new OGR driver
`here <http://szekerest.blogspot.com/2010/09/ogr-ms-sql-2008-spatial-driver.html>`__.
Tamasâ€™s work is becoming invaluable to many of my projects â€" and he was
also responsible for the `MapServer SQL Server 2008
driver <http://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-38.html>`__.

The MSSQLSpatial driver is not currently available in the latest
version of FWTools (2.4.7 at the time of writing). FWTools (Frank
Warmerdam tools) is an easy to install package containing both GDAL and
OGR, but keep an eye on the http://fwtools.maptools.org/ site for new
releases.

The driver was not a part of the GDAL 1.7 release, so if you canâ€™t wait
until the next binary (precompiled)
`release <http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries>`__,
you have to compile it yourself. However Tamas maintains a page which
automatically compiles the latest MapServer source code into binaries at
http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/. MapServer includes the latest development
GDAL and OGR binaries (gdal18dev.dll) which in turn include the new
`MSSQLSpatial
driver <http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/PackageInfo.aspx?file=release-1310-gdal-mapserver.zip>`__.
So this is currently the easiest place to get a compiled version for
testing with SQL Server.

Quick Set Up of OGR & MSSQLSpatial (on Windows)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though at the time of writing the latest development builds for
MapServer failed the GDAL/OGR DLLs and .exes seem fine and can be found
in the bin/gdal subfolder of the MapServer packages. To quickly get up
and running with OGR you can follow these steps:

1. Download a suitable package from http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/. You
will need a development release, or a release with GDAL 1.8 or higher.
Click on the information links to see which OGR types are supported in a
package.

2. Unzip the package to your machine. It is best to put the package in a
folder which does not contain spaces.

3. Run the following commands in a Windows Command Line window. I left
the package in my D:\\My Documents\\Downloads\\ folder in this example.

::

    D:   
    cd "D:\My Documents\Downloads\release-1500-gdal-mapserver\"    
    SDKShell.bat setenv hideoci

The SDKShell.bat file sets all the GDAL environment variables for your
command window session. The hideoci parameter is used to move the Oracle
driver plugin out of GDAL â€" otherwise if you try and run commands you
get the following error (unless the Oracle client is installed on your
machine):

    *This application has Failed to start because OCI.dll was not Found.
    Re-installing the application may fix this problem*

The hideoci parameter did not work for me due to the spaces in my folder
path, so I manually did what the .bat file was meant to do â€" move the
ogr\_OCI.dll, and gdal\_GEOR.dll files out of bin\\gdal\\plugins\\ and
into a new bin\\gdal\\plugins-optional folder.

Once this was done I was able to run the following command to check the
OGR formats:

::

     ogrinfo.exe â€"-formats

|image| Everyone loves aerial photography. Some of its `early
pioneers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Cotton#Spy_missions>`__
were the James Bonds of their era. Twenty years ago people could go
round neighbourhoods in England and sell people frames photographs of
their houses from the air.

Today people spend hours looking at the aerial photography layer on
Google Maps wondering why so many people have outdoor swimming pools in
the UK..

People also like `free
data <http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/index.php>`__. And companies like
`data free from the Google Terms of
Service <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Faq#Why_don.27t_you_just_use_Google_Maps.2Fwhoever_for_your_data.3F>`__
even more. The successful `OpenStreetMap
wiki <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenAerialMap>`__ refers to
what seems to be the perfect datasource - the
`OpenAerialMap <http://openaerialmap.org/>`__ (OAM) project, however it
starts with the rather ominous opening statement:

*It was available at*
`*http://openaerialmap.org/* <http://openaerialmap.org/>`__ *but...*

The reasons for its demise are documented by `Christopher
Schmidt <http://crschmidt.net/>`__ (a major force in the development of
OpenLayers and TileCache) in `this post to the mailing
list <http://openaerialmap.org/pipermail/talk_openaerialmap.org/2008-December/000055.html>`__.
In summary the main reasons for failure were technical - dealing with
the huge amounts of raster data and getting disk space.

`Cedric Mouillet <http://mapfishblog.blogspot.com/>`__ asked on `the
mailing
list <http://openaerialmap.org/pipermail/talk_openaerialmap.org/2010-April/000361.html>`__
what was the state of the project, to see if it could be used as
reference mapping for the `OpenAddresses <www.openaddresses.org>`__
project. No answers were posted.

There is still however life in the movement. A conference call was made
at the start of May 2010 to discuss the `hardware set-up of the
project <http://openaerialmap.org/OAM_Hardware_Conference_Call>`__.
Included in the attendees list for the call and on the `OAM Steering
Committee <http://www.openaerialmap.org/OAM_Steering_Committee>`__ are
members of OSGeo which may prove critical to the future of the project.

Anyway here’s hoping to a successful second version of OAM. In the
meantime Google’s aerial photography service (followed by Bing and
Yahoo) will remain way out in front terms of `data quality,
quantity <http://www.terrametrics.com/support/faqs_content.htm>`__, and
ease of access. Just remember it is only “free” in one sense.

|image| Moving to new versions in OpenSource has in the past been like
playing Russian roulette. Just now clicking on "Upgrade to WordPress
3.0" I thought would lead to a greater understanding of the database
schema, template inconsistencies, and plug-in idiosynchrocies of
WordPress as I met an inevitable "Upgrade Failed. Please see log for
details" message.

But no! **Five seconds** later, all was successful, and everything
looked as before. There have been numerous `bug fixes and
improvements <http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0>`__, but after a
brief look through the list I didn‚Äôt see any ‚Äúkiller‚Äù new features.

In the world of GIS however there are a number of important new versions
coming up this summer.

`OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenLayers 3.0 development has started. Key features and ideology are
`listed
here <http://openlayers.org/pipermail/dev/2010-June/006189.html>`__.
There is also a `wiki page <http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/three>`__.
There is a move towards separating the core functions from the UI. I get
the feeling OpenLayers could be moving from a homage to the Google Maps
API , into a full JavaScript / browser geospatial framework.

    The core should focus on the following:

    -  layer management - tile handling & vector rendering
    -  map & layer related event handling
    -  server/client communication - generating requests and parsing
       responses
    -  geometry digitization & editing

    A separate OpenLayers UI lib should focus on the following:

    -  rendering of buttons and other widgets
    -  presenting map information that is not rendered as features
       (layer properties, feature attributes)
    -  gathering user input for map configuration, queries, etc.

`MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the server side of things, it seems
`GeoServer <http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Welcome>`__ has recently
had more traction than the older MapServer. However there will soon be
(sometime in July if I understand correctly) a `version
6 <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/wiki/60ReleasePlan>`__.¬† This has a
number of new items I‚Äôve recently required for a new project, and they
are now tantalisingly within reach. These include:

-  XML mapfile consumption: run-time compilation (XML/XSLT => .map) or
   embedded XML parser *- it will then be possible to easily generate
   and manipulate MapFiles from a database, or script (I‚Äôm sure these
   already exist, but moving to XML will mean all sorts of powerful
   libraries in any language can be used to do this)*
-  Output formats: KML and GeoJSON ‚Ä" *excellent news! I‚Äôve tried WFS,
   and I don‚Äôt like it. Its nowhere near as ubiquitous as KML (a now
   open standard) , or as easy to manipulate as JSON.*
-  Tile caching support *‚Ä" whilst it is slightly annoying that having
   got to grips with* `*TileCache* <http://tilecache.org/>`__ *and
   Windows it looks like it will be integrated into MapServer, one less
   system component to deal with is always a good thing.*

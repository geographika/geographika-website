I know I see this error about once a year and can never remember the
cause, so I'm writing it down this time!

In my case it has always been related to SQL queries and Access
databases. Check the following if your SQL command produces this error
when executed:

#. The database is not read only - Visual Source Safe can often be a
   culprit in setting this property..
#. The SQL query may contain fields that are reserve words (e.g. DATE,
   TOP etc.). These should all be renamed in the database (I normally
   add an underscore at the end).
#. Go through a long and tedious process of which Windows user is
   running the SQL (ASPNET, IUSR\_COMPUTERNAME etc.) and check thy have
   write permissions to the folder containing the database, and the
   database file itself. Remember Access needs to create those pesky
   .ldb lock files..

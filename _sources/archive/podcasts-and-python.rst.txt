I've been listening recently to ".NET Rocks!" twice weekly .NET
development podcasts. It is very easy to listen to, mainly due to the
personalities of the presenters, and it gives a good overview of .NET
develpment and related technologies. Software development as a whole is
often discussed - test driven development, agile programming,
management, spaghetti code...

A full `archive <http://www.dotnetrocks.com/archives.aspx>`__\ of
previous episodes is available for download (for free), and I found an
epsiode that gives a good introduction to Python - it can be downloaded
`here <http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=203>`__. I'm
still not convinced of the use of Python and ArcObjects as explaining
how to run scripts with parameters to GIS users, or creating custom
toolboxes, takes as much time as creating a nice UI in Visual Studio. In
the show one of the presenters asks "*but don't you miss the Visual
Studio environment and intellisense*?", which I couldn't agree more
with. However there is also mention of IronPython, which I knew had
something to do with .NET, but it can also apparently be used within the
Visual Studio environment which could make life a whole lot easier.

I'm off to download
`IronPython  <http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython>`__\ now...

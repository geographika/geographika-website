|image| With an `impending
election <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8496591.stm>`__ in
the UK, the Conservatives, the current opposition party have decided to
try and win some votes by `cutting spending in
IT <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/29/osborne_it/>`__. On the
upside they plan to scrap `ID cards <http://www.no2id.net/>`__ if
elected. Which GIS projects this may affect is impossible to tell as:

*He [the shadow chancellor] was unable to cite specific projects, as
opposition parties are not allowed to inspect government contracts.*

What would be ideal is if IT projects were able to be scrutinised by the
opposition parties, *and* the public. It appears Australia is far more
open with their government tenders, and even include the *`actual
costs <https://www.tenders.gov.au/?keyword=gis&event=public.advancedsearch.keyword&orderBy=Publish+Date&submitSort=Go>`__*
involved which would be considered as extremely sensitive business data
in other countries.

During the good times IT projects are always associated with savings and
efficiencies. During the bad times they now seem to be seen as an
extravagance, and `prone to
failure <http://www.computing.co.uk/computing/comment/2248138/why-failure-comes-easy-4785962>`__.
A good point made in `the
comments <http://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/1/2010/03/29/osborne_it/>`__
on `The Register
article <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/29/osborne_it/>`__ was:

    Personally, I'd like all large businesses subject to the same
    auditing and publishing requirements that government IT projects are
    so we can get some perspective. Starting with the media. I strongly
    suspect that government projects are no worse than anyone else's,
    but they're the only ones open to serious scrutiny.

Amongst the projects likely to face cuts is the `National Programme for
IT <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_National_Programme_for_IT>`__ a
National Health Service IT project with  a budget of around £12bn, that
was set to be *“the world's biggest civil information technology
programme."* Whether or not patients are likely to benefit is very much
`up for
debate <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1548813/Patients-wont-benefit-from-12bn-IT-project.html>`__.
What does seem to be lacking in this plan is the use of GIS and
geospatial technologies, apparently due to a `lack of
expertise <http://www.gisdevelopment.net/magazine/years/2005/jun/service1.htm>`__.
Maybe ESRI should have sent the NHS `their
brochure <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/187910265X?ie=UTF8&tag=geographika-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=187910265X>`__.

Where the government (or their advisors) may previously have
`FAIL <http://www.epicfail.com/>`__\ ed is their desire for centralised
databases and systems. This approach may have recently changed to a more
decentralised `linked data
approach <http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/140>`__.

    *[Linked data] is about using URIs to identify things, providing
    information at the end of those URIs that is self-descriptive, and
    linking those things to other things through typed links.*

seems to think it’s a step in the right direction - which is always a
good thing. Have a look at the `new site <http://data.gov.uk/>`__ to
judge for yourselves. The use of linked data rather than databases in
`walled
gardens <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_%28technology%29>`__,
allows for all sorts of applications to be created by both the public
and private sector such as this `expenditure
map <http://ishortman.com/projects/expendituremap/>`__ (I’ll forgive the
use of Flash just this once..). The amount of mash-ups that can be
created is now only limited by the imagination. Notice how maps are high
on the `list of ideas <http://data.gov.uk/ideas>`__.

A change that has occurred in the UK that could be seen as on a par with
`Obama’s health
reforms <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8579322.stm>`__ is the
`freeing of
data <http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/free-our-data>`__. Recently
the `Ordnance Survey <http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk>`__ `released free
mapping <http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/19/ordnance-survey-maps-free-online>`__.
This seems to have had a knock on effect with the Post Office `relaxing
copyright <http://data.gov.uk/ideas/post-office-and-os-relax-copyright-and-licences-uk-address-and-coordinate-data>`__
on postcodes (the zip code equivalent). Although it may have helped that
this has been available for download on `The Pirate
Bay <http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5090599/UK_government_database_of_all_1_841_177_post_codes>`__
since last September.  [**Clarification** - the Ordnance Surey have
released the geographic locations of postcodes, but the Post Office have
*not* released the database `linking actual postal addresses to
postcodes <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8402327.stm>`__].

So even though the cuts to IT may have an impact if there is a change of
government, the opening up of data will create far more opportunities to
geospatial developers, who will now be able to build workable systems
and prototypes using real data to proactively drive IT projects rather
than wait for the high hand of government to possibly offer them some
crumbs from the table.

An important part of the blog will be code snippets. I thought it would
be prettier if these snippets had the same nicely coloured syntax as I
have in Visual Studio 2005. As will all things computer based things are
never easy, and take time. After a good hour or so of messing around I
found the following:

i) Copying and pasting to Word or Frontpage will convert the text to
HTML (of a fashion..), but spacing and fonts are not retained, and the
time spent cleaning up the code is probably equal to manually coding the
HTML from scratch.

ii) I found a .NET macro that can be added to Visual Studio at Jeff
Atwood's blog - `Coding
Horror <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000429.html>`__. This
was a useful exercise in seeing how .NET macros could be written and run
from Visual Studio, and what is involved in converting the text.
Unfortunately when posting in the WordPress code box there were gaps
appeared between code lines that had to be deleted manually. For large
amounts of code this became somewhat annoying...

iii) The solution! A link from the page at `Coding
Horror <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000429.html>`__
suggested a Visual Studio Add-In created by Colin Coller at his blog
`Needs
Improvement <http://www.jtleigh.com/people/colin/blog/archives/2004/10/copysourceashtm.html>`__
- the latest version can be found
`here <http://www.jtleigh.com/people/colin/software/CopySourceAsHtml/>`__.
This Add-In creates a short cut when right clicking on selected code in
Visual Studio, with a variety of options such as including code line
numbers, and setting indent levels. The HTML can be pasted in WordPress
and is displayed perfectly. The only minor problem seems to be if I then
run the spell checker some spaces disappear. I'll just have to be more
careful when writing in futur.

Another interesting find, that is not really a requirement for the blog,
is this `web
control <http://www.actiprosoftware.com/Products/DotNet/ASPNET/CodeHighlighter/Default.aspx>`__.
This allows a code text property to be set and when the web page is
generated it can be rendered with syntax highlighting from a wide choice
of programming languages.

 3 Dim LotsOfTimeSaved As Long = 10

 4

 5 Try

 6 'copying and pasting

 7 LotsOfTimeSaved += 10

 8 Catch ex As Exception

 9 'not needed =)

 10 Finally

 11 'no need to search for another solution!

 12 End Try

 13

 14 End Sub

I've since found the following link which allows VB code to be pasted
online to return HTML - http://www.zilpher.com/colourcode.php

Error messages always seem to make far more sense when you know the
solution.

*System.IO.FileNotFoundException was unhandled
   Message="Could not load file or assembly 'GISSettings,
Version=1.0.0.17923, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its
dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified."*

This error occurred when building a deployment project in Visual Studio
2005. The GISSettings was a custom made DLL that was referenced by
another custom DLL, and it was definitely still there on my machine...

The cause of this was that the second project was looking for a specific
version of the GISSettings DLL which no longer existed. I had automated
the version numbers for all my DLLs by using the 1.0.0.\* syntax for the
Assembly Version in the Assembly information of each project. The
solution was as follows:

| - Show all the files for the project in Visual Studio
|  - Expand the References
|  - Check that the Copy Local Property for the relevant DLL is set to
true

I had referenced several other custom DLLs which had this property set
to true, so why this one had behaved differently I have no idea..VS 2005
does seem to have a few idiosyncrasies, such as when half my projects in
a solution disappear, so I guess I'll have to wait for a few more
service packs before I start blaming myself for these issues =)

One of the main barriers I had to using
`MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`__ as a web GIS server was that
layers had to be symbolised i\ |qgis|\ n a text editor, using a MAPFILE.
It was cumbersome to keep editing and refreshing a browser, there was no
easy way to check for errors, and you have to learn the syntax and
keywords.

Whilst this is ok for smaller projects where I could make these myself,
larger projects require non-programmers to gather data, symbolise it,
and handle the map layouts and creation.

I've just discovered that another of the
`OSGeo <http://www.osgeo.org/>`__'s projects, `Quantum
GIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`__ (often abbreviated to QGIS) has a tool
that can take a map project created and symbolised in the desktop
application, and export it to a MAPFILE which can be read by MapServer.
This seems to be the missing link in a complete\ `Open Source GIS
stack <http://kelsocartography.com/blog/?p=1098>`__.

I had a few problems finding where this tool was installed. By default
the Python files should be in the
C:\\OSGeo4W\\apps\\qgis\\python\\plugins\\mapserver\_export directory,
however this directory did not exist after running through a default
installation without paying attention.

OSGeo have a `custom installer <http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`__ that
you can use to install all their software including MapServer,
QuantumGIS, and `GRASS <http://www.osgeo.org/grass>`__. To install
Quantum GIS follow the notes on this `wiki
page <http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/OsGeo4wSetup>`__. Clearly you need
to select QGIS, but the MapServer Export tool also requires
**python-qgis**. I think I missed this the first time round, however you
can always rerun the installer to add new packages and libraries.

Once you have the Python for QGIS library installed open QGIS, and go to
Plugins >> Fetch Python Plugins. The MapServer Export plug-in should be
installed. Now go to Plug-Ins >> Manage Plugins and check the MapServer
Export box as below.

You should now see a new MapServer Export menu item on the Plugins menu.

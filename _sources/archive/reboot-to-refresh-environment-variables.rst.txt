I wasn’t aware that if you change Windows environment variables that are
used by IIS then **you need to reboot the machine** for the changes to
take effect. As described by `David
Wong <http://w3-4u.blogspot.com/2006/12/qa-iis-and-environment-variable-updates.html>`__

    *This is because NT services like IIS inherit their environment from
    services.exe, which does not get updated when you change system
    environment until you reboot.*

This knowledge may save a couple of hours of frustration if you are
running Python scripts on IIS through
`PyISAPIe <http://geographika.co.uk/setting-up-python-on-iis7>`__.

If you add paths to your PYTHONPATH or PATH system variables to use a
Python package (such as MapScript or GDAL), then the same script may run
without problems in IDLE, but continue to produce errors when run
through the web server.

If you are running a script in
`IDLE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_%28Python%29>`__ then you need
to restart IDLE itself to refresh the environment variables.

Other Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I’ve not tried this method myself but `R.
Teachout <http://www.teachout.com/Blog/tabid/165/EntryId/246/Windows-Environment-Variables-Overrides-for-IIS6.aspx>`__
suggests a registry hack that allows you to override the Windows
environment variables in IIS 6.

You can also override the environment variables in the Python scripts
themselves. For example to change the GDAL\_DRIVER\_PATH variable use:

::

    os.environ[“GDAL_DRIVER_PATH”] = “C:\ms4w\gdalplugins”

To print out current environment variables (assuming you are testing in
IDLE):

::

    print os.getenv(“GDAL_DRIVER_PATH”)

|image| There a number of benefits to using a cascading
`WMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service>`__ service â€" a WMS
service that is read and then forwarded on through an intermediary WMS
server:

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   you can cache the service (for example with
   `TileCache <http://tilecache.org/>`__) to greatly improve performance

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   your application need only worry about a single point of connection,
   using WMS layers aggregated from many different sources

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   you can add additional metadata missing from the source

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   services can be reprojected (using `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`__)

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   you can merge WMS layers together and server them out as a new map
   layer

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

There are also some negatives:

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   you have additional server configuration to set up and maintain

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   if you are not adding or changing the WMS service you should probably
   connect to the WMS service directly in the client applications,
   otherwise there will be a performance hit

      </div>

   caching may contravene the licensing agreement of the original WMS
   source

The rest of this post details the steps in setting up a cascading WMS
using `MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`__. You need MapServer 5.4.1 or
higher to implement a secure cascaded WMS service. This example uses a
64-bit version of MapServer 5.6 taken from `Tamas
Szekeres <http://szekerest.blogspot.com/>`__\ â€™s `autobuilds
site <http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/>`__ installed in a C:\\ms4w64 folder.
It also assumes MapServer has been configured with SSL `as detailed in
another
post <http://geographika.co.uk/64-bit-curl-with-openssl-on-windows>`__.
In this example I use IIS and Windows Server 2003.

MapFile Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuring a MapFile for a cascading WMS service is well-documented on
the `MapServer WMS Client
page <http://mapserver.org/ogc/wms_client.htm>`__. An example is shown
below. Note that this service is not reprojected, and the username and
password can be passed through the metadata parameters.

::

    LAYER
    Â  NAME "MyLayer"
    Â  TYPE RASTER
    Â  STATUS OFF
    Â  CONNECTION â€œhttps://webservicesâ€¦â€
    Â  CONNECTIONTYPE WMS
    Â  #DEBUG 5 #to debug the original layer
    Â  METADATA
    Â Â Â  "wms_srs"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  "EPSG:2157"
    Â Â Â  "wms_name"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  "0"
    Â Â Â  "wms_server_version"Â  "1.1.1"
    Â Â Â  "wms_format"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  "image/png"
    Â Â Â  "wms_auth_username" "username"
    Â Â Â  "wms_auth_password" "password"
    Â Â Â  "wms_bgcolor" "0xFFFFFF"
    Â  END
    END

It is vital you set up debugging for the MapFile to see why a connection
may be failing. You can set this by adding the following lines to the
MapFile:

::

    DEBUG 5 #debugging level between 1 and 5, 5 is the most detailed
    CONFIG "MS_ERRORFILE" "C:/ms4w64/tmp/ms.log"
    #path to log file - ensure IIS can write to this file

This can be removed once everything is working correctly.

Configuring SSL and MapServer (Part 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A secure WMS service is one that uses an **https**:// address, and may
require a username and password. Setting up MapServer to connect using
SSL is by far the trickiest part of the configuration. First of all I
had to `compile my own
libcurl.dll <http://geographika.co.uk/64-bit-curl-with-openssl-on-windows>`__
to include `OpenSSL <http://www.openssl.org/>`__. Otherwise I got the
following error in the log file:

*msHTTPExecuteRequests(): HTTP request error. HTTP: request failed with
curl error code 1 (Protocol https not supported or disabled in libcurl)*

Once I had the new libcurl.dll I replaced the existing file in the
C:\\ms4w64\\bin folder (always make a back-up of the original files
first!) with my freshly compiled version. I used `Process
Monitor <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx>`__
toÂ  see if I was missing any other DLLs â€" I was. The libcurl.dll
required some additional OpenSSL DLLs to connect to https addresses.
These DLLs were:

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   libeay32.dll

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

-  

   .. raw:: html

      <div>

   ssleay32.dll

   .. raw:: html

      </div>

These too I copied into my C:\\mapserver\\bin folder from the
openssl-1.0.0a\\out32dll folder created `when compiling
libcurl.dll <http://geographika.co.uk/64-bit-curl-with-openssl-on-windows>`__.
Next I got the following error:

*HTTP: request failed with curl error code 60 (SSL certificate problem,
verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
 error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3\_GET\_SERVER\_CERTIFICATE:certificate
verify failed) for https://â€¦*

These errors relate to `missing
certificates <http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/WMS-Layer-with-secure-http-url-td2807534.html#a2814037>`__.
For more details on security certificates `see this
page <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html>`__.

Getting a Security Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I needed to get a valid certificate from the web service and point
MapServer to this file. I was able to get a certificate by typing in the
service;s https:// url in FireFox, and then selecting Tools > Page Info
> Security > View Certificate > Details > Export. You can also
right-click on the padlock icon at the bottom of the page to access the
same option.

When exporting I selected the â€œX 509 Certificate with chain (PEM)â€
option. I tried an export without the â€œchainâ€ but this didnâ€™t allow me
to connect.

Iâ€™d recommend trying to connect to the site independently of MapServer,
so any issues can be narrowed to certificate problems rather than the
MapServer configuration. I ran these tests on my development machine â€" a
32bit Windows XP laptop, following these steps:

1. Install a standalone version of cURL from the `cURL download
page <http://curl.haxx.se/download.html>`__ (I used
libcurl-7.19.3-win32-ssl-msvc.zip).

2. Save your security certificate with the filename
**curl-ca-bundle.crt** in the same folder as you unzipped the curl.exe
file. Placing it in the same folder, with this name, will mean the
certificate can be read by cURL. |image|

In a DOS window navigate to the folder with the curl.exe file and run
the following command to see if the certificate works with the site. Add
in some valid WMS parameters.

::

    curl https://webserveraddress.com/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=...

If you need to pass in a username and password to the service use:

::

    curl https://username:password@webserveraddress.com/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=...

If you get the following error:

*(60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK.
Details:error:14090086:SSL
routines:SSL3\_GET\_SERVER\_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed*

It means your certificate is invalid. You can try the command with a
**/k** switch to ignore the security and check that there isnâ€™t a
connection problem rather than a security problem:

::

    curl https://username:password@webserveraddress.com/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=... /k

If all went well with the certificate you should get a DOS window filled
with random characters:

|image|

This is good! It is an image file viewed as text and means you have
successfully returned an image from the secure WMS server.

Configuring SSL and MapServer (Part 2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now all that remains is to set up the certificate on the MapServer.
There are some `instructions
here <http://213.207.42.55/README_INSTALL.html#g-certificates-for-https-with-wms-wfs-servers>`__
and `more here. <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/3070>`__ I got a
little confused thinking I could point to the certificate file using a
CONFIG command in the MapFile to set the environment variable. This is
not the case.

It must be setÂ  using a Windows environment variable (although you can
set it in Apache if youâ€™re not using IIS). It took a while for me to
figure this out, but due to the beauty of OpenSource if you get too
stuck you can search the sourcecode itself to see how parameters are
used. The `relevant sourcecode can be found
here <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/browser/branches/branch-5-6/mapserver/maphttp.c>`__.

I created a new Windows environment variable CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE to point
to the .crt file as shown below:

|image|

And this time in the log â€" success!

| [Wed Jul 07 16:04:55 2010].384000 msDrawMap(): kicking into non-square
pixel preserving mode.
|  [Wed Jul 07 16:04:55 2010].838000 HTTP: Starting to prepare HTTP
requests.
|  [Wed Jul 07 16:04:55 2010].838000 Using
CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE=C:\\ms4w64\\bin\\curl-ca-bundle.crt

Poor Image Quality?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes the WMS images lack the quality of the originals when run
through a cascaded service. `This
post <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.mapserver.user/41900>`__
attributes it to either reprojection or incompatible output formats. In
my case it was the latter. As the forum post writer says â€" if you arenâ€™t
reprojecting or adding information then using a proxy rather than a
cascading WMS would be far more efficient.

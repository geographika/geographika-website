This step should be simple. Run the Visual Studio 2008 SetUp program and
check the “X64 Compilers and Tools” option under Visual C++

However firstly don’t run the set up program from the DVD or from an ISO
on your hard-disk or you'll end up with the following error:

*'A problem has been encountered while loading the setup components.
Canceling setup'*

You need to run the Visual Studio set up through Add/Remove Programs.
However once I’d selected the components I got the error below - *“A
selected drive is no longer valid. Please review your installation path
settings before continuing with setup.”* Of course ***there is no***
***option*** to review or even see your drive settings…

Thanks to `this
thread <http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vssetup/thread/2f3d0378-3175-49ae-acb7-012594a1bf3c>`__,
the solution was to uninstall Visual Studio SP1 through Add/Remove
programs (check the “Show Updates” box to see service packs and hot
fixes for various programs).

Finally I got the 64-bit compilers installed, and could begin trying to
compile `PyISAPIe <http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyisapie>`__ for a
64-bit processor which is a whole different set of problems.

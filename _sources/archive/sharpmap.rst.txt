I have recently downloaded, and been playing around with an OpenSource
map renderer for the .Net 2.0 framework - SharpMap.

The development site can be found at http://www.codeplex.com/SharpMap.
The development site is stored in CodePlex which is descriped in
Wikipedia as a site website for OpenSource projects hosted by Microsoft
providing "wiki pages, source control based on Team Foundation Server,
discussion forums, issue tracking, project tagging, RSS support,
statistics, and releases. " This is the first time I have heard of
CodePlex, but it is an interesting and well designed concept in itself.

SharpMap itself is very quick to install and comes with a set of demo
pages that show some very fancy AJAX zooming, WMS capabilities, and
symbology. The code classes themselves seem simple to use, and getting
some of your own test data into a sample page was quick and easy. I hope
to get a sample site together myself in the coming months, as it seems a
very useful way to publish data without having to pay extortionate
license fees in order to display geographic data - on a Windows server.
In the meantime feast your eyes on this lavish screenshot...

A few sample ArcToolbox commands I've been using recently. These can be
run from the command line available in ArcCatalog (in the menu select
Window >> Command Line).

*workspace C:\\MyPath\\MyGeoDatabase.mdb
 Intersect (featureClass1'';'featureDataset1\\featureClass2' '')
my\_output\_featureClassÂ ALL # INPUT*

This automates the Intersect tool, found in ArcToolbox under "Analysis
Tools >> Overlay >> Intersect" and is useful if this is a process that
has to be run several times, and can be part of a batch process. The
first line sets the workspace to a geodatabase containing the two input
classes, and the second line runs the intersect, outputting all fields
to *my\_output\_featureClass*.

*workspace C:\\MyPath\\MyGeoDatabase.mdb
 delete myFeatureClass*

This command deletes a feature class in the geodatabase.

More samples can be found in the ArcGIS Desktop Help under the
"Geoprocessing tool reference" section.

..or do geodevelopers require mathematics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|MyCircle.Area seems simpler..| Alan Skorkin has a great post on “\ `you
don’t need math skills to be a good developer but you do need them to be
a great
one <http://www.skorks.com/2010/03/you-dont-need-math-skills-to-be-a-good-developer-but-you-do-need-them-to-be-a-great-one/>`__.”
Geo-technology developers have similar requirements, and the majority of
GISs revolve around
`CRUD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`__
operations. However due to the nature of spatial data we occasionally
get to meddle in the world’s
of \ `projections <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection>`__,
geometry,
`typology <http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Topology_basics>`__,
and `set theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory>`__ more than
our counterparts in other sectors.

The Ancient Mysteries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|There are now five bridges in Königsberg..|\ Whilst concentrating on
algorithms and
`recursion <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi>`__ is a
definite benefit to all developers, us *spatial* developers need a few
more specific tricks. 
`Euler's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler>`__ 1736 paper on
`Seven Bridges of
Königsberg <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg>`__
is one of the first academic writings on modern topology. The titles of
these mathematics puzzles create an aura of mysteriousness and arcane
knowledge that definitely sweetens the somewhat dour algebra underneath.

The solution (or non-solution) to this problem underpins many of the
more advanced techniques used by GIS packages today. The “\ `Travelling
Salesman <http://gebweb.net/optimap/>`__\ ”, whilst conjuring up less
interesting images, relies on similar principles of graph theory.

`Graph Theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The excellent ESRI online documentation provides details on all aspects
of GIS, including `networks and
graphs <http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/dotnet/e084da94-d4f7-4da7-86ed-7df684ff2144.htm>`__.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="167" caption="What can happen if
you don’t understand typology"]\ |Some M. C. Escher works illustrate
topological concepts, such as Möbius strips and non-orientable
spaces|\ [/caption]

    *Graph theory is the foundation for understanding networks and
    topology. A geographic information system (GIS) modeller should be
    familiar with the concepts and terminology of graph theory because
    it helps to classify and model connectivity and adjacency
    relationships among geographic features.*

The underlying graphs of a network allow us to solve problems such as
finding a shortest route, or analysing connectivity between points on a
river network. It could certainly help a `Chinese
Postman <http://www.uclic.ucl.ac.uk/harold/cpp/>`__.

Whilst being able to implement these algorithms from scratch is beyond
the call of duty for most developers (except those who like to `reinvent
the
wheel <http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/03/8-reasons-for-re-inventing-wheel-as.html>`__),
an understanding of how they work, and being able to recognise the
situations where they can be used, can save weeks of development time
and lead to cleaner more elegant coding solutions.

`Self-Learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you out in the “real-world” it is highly unlikely you are ever
going to get taught this maths, and it becomes a little daunting
realising you are now responsible for `your own
education <http://lifehacker.com/software/education/technophilia-get-a-free-college-education-online-201979.php>`__.
Even if you’ve already studied maths to a reasonable level, as the adage
says - `*use it or lose
it* <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207091859.htm>`__.
This is brought home by my worriying belief that my mental arithmetic
was superior as a child through constant use and learning tables by
rote, than it is now after 10 years of programming.

Every now and again its useful to buy a book that deals with areas
`related to computer
science <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486247759?ie=UTF8&tag=geographika-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0486247759>`__,
rather than a “How to..” book of the latest programming language or
framework, to try and attain a broader understanding of the maths behind
the APIs.

Graph-ics
~~~~~~~~~

To try and illustrate my point that only a basic understanding of a
branch of mathematics is required to produce useful, and sometimes
spectacular results I attempted to use a specialised open-source tool
armed with only a basic glossary of the `terms
used <http://primes.utm.edu/cgi-bin/caldwell/tutor/graph/glossary.html>`__
in graph theory.

`Gephi <http://gephi.org/>`__ is “an interactive visualization and
exploration `platform <http://gephi.org/features/>`__ for all kinds of
networks and complex systems, dynamic and hierarchical graphs.”

Amongst the `sample
datasets <http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Datasets>`__ there is an
adjacency network of common adjectives and nouns in the `David
Copperfield <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_%28novel%29>`__.
I was able to import the data into the program and then export the SVG
image shown below. Interestingly “happy” is seems to have as many
connections to love as money, which is pleasant.

|image|

`Gephi <http://gephi.org/>`__ produces `beautiful
data <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596157118?ie=UTF8&tag=geographika-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596157118>`__
and is definitely a project to keep an eye on - the `Road map for
version 1.0 <http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Roadmap>`__ includes
Geographic data (latitude/longitude) which will open up all sorts of
possibilities.

Do the Math(s)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I’d categorise most people coding in the geospatial area (outside of
those in academia or writing the internals of a GIS library), as
developers, rather than `computer scientists or
programmers <http://www.skorks.com/2010/03/the-difference-between-a-developer-a-programmer-and-a-computer-scientist/>`__.

    ***(Developers) are consummate generalists without any truly deep
    specializations**. They are expert at finding ways around problems
    and plugging components together to fulfil a set of requirements.*

A basic understanding of each of the branches of mathematics used by GIS
is required to know what exactly you need to input, and to understand
the output, of algorithms implemented by others. A grasp of terminology
certainly helps navigate the user interfaces of specialised tools, or
find help through search engines. At the very least it leads to an
understanding of why `Manifold <http://www.manifold.net/index.shtml>`__
is named `manifold <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold>`__, and can
stop or start us going round in
`circles <http://www.google.com/search?q=recursion>`__.

I use Visio for a number of tasks. For creating geodatabase models in
ArcGIS, for system architecture diagrams, and for data flow models. It
may not be the easiest program to use, but the alternatives are often
too simplistic, or worse.

| I wanted to generate a nice diagram of a SQL Server database I had
created, and automatically create hyperlinks that would pop up an Ajax
box with sample records directly from the database. In order to do this
each hyperlink had to have a variable based on the table/entity name.
However it soon became apparent that there is no easy way to access the
entity name in VBA from its associated shape object. The solution to
this is the **VisioModelingEngine** library which provides access to the
UML, but does *not* provide access to the shapes.

There appears to be very little documentation on using the classes in
this library. I found a couple of examples at
http://www.eggheadcafe.com/forumarchives/visiodeveloperVisualBasica/Jul2005/post23423796.asp
and

My eventual workaround involves temporarily changing the first attribute
in an entity to the entity name, searching through the shape's text for
this name, recording the ID and then changing it back. The idea was
based on `this
post <http://www.eggheadcafe.com/conversation.aspx?messageid=32580685&threadid=32580682>`__
which hinted that was what they did, but then frustratingly didn't post
their solution.

Anyway the main use of the code is to associate a Visio entity
(IVMEEntity) with its shape.

A good source of VBA scripts for Visio can be found at
http://visualsignals.typepad.co.uk/vislog/ this provided me with the
code for looping through shapes on a page.

|image| Maybe I’m a `little
late <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/30/firefox_3point5_review/>`__
in finding this, but if you have FireFox 3.5 or higher try clicking
`this link <#>`__ (you will have to agree to let your browser divulge
your location to open the link). The JavaScript code run when clicking
the link is as follows, and can also be pasted directly into your
address bar:

::

    javascript:navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    function(position){
    window.location.href="http://maps.google.com/?ll="+position.coords.latitude+",
    "+position.coords.longitude;});

I believe the navigator.geolocation object is also available in Safari,
iPhone, and Chrome. The `Mozilla
documentation <http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/>`__
provides more details on its use. This `StackOverflow
question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1349064/which-devices-support-javascript-geolocation-via-navigator-geolocation>`__
asks which browsers and devices it applies to, and this is set to grow
if it becomes part of the browser standards - the W3C has an online
draft `Geolocation API
Specification <http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html>`__. They list
the following `use
cases <http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#usecases>`__:

-  Find points of interest in the user's area
-  Annotating content with location information
-  Show the user's position on a map
-  Turn-by-turn route navigation
-  Alerts when points of interest are in the user's vicinity
-  Up-to-date local information
-  Location-tagged status updates in social networking applications

There is also a framework API *aligned* to the W3C specification at
http://code.google.com/p/geo-location-javascript/

In the week that ArcGIS is released as a `“cloud
service” <http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/05/24/arcgis-com-beta-goes-live/>`__,
I believe the real power of the Internet will come more from
manipulating and `combining data
services <http://geographika.co.uk/?p=517>`__ than putting desktop
applications in a browser. Especially if these applications can’t easily
integrate open web services. When the full range of ArcGIS geoprocessing
tools can be fed streams of GeoJSON, combined with user location, then
the geocloud will have truely arrived.

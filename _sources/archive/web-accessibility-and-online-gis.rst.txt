Is it impossible?!

Online maps are visual, there is no getting round this basic premise.
The use of a summary attribute for a map element in a page is the only
thing I can think of that would be of any use. This works in the same
was as an alt attribute for an image - screen readers will read this
text out to users who have problems visual impairments.

As the majority of online mapping servers generate images as output
there could probably be further development in customising the ALT
attributes of these images to provide more detailed information of the
current map state, so rather than alt="A Map", alt="Map showing towns
and major roads." This alt text could be derived from visible layers,
and the centre coordinates of the current map location.

I tried running one of my map URLs on the online validator at
http://webxact.watchfire.com/ which tests "single pages of web content
for **quality**, **accessibility**, and **privacy** issues." It timed
out...

http://wave.webaim.org/wave/Output.jsp performs similar checks..what can
best be described as a mess was returned along with lots of "page not
found errors."

Fortunately clients do not seem to demand that accessibility standards
are met for mapping pages, but with increasing legislation in many
countries for websites to be usable by people with disabilites it is
definitely an area that needs further work.

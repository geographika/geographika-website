Yes, I'd like to see the map layers and capabilities available from my
`MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`__ MAP file, and no I don't want to
download mapserv.exe..

Messing with Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I had the same problem with both Firefox and Internet Explorer 7 each
time I issues a request such as:

::

    http://geographika.azurewebsites.net/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/my.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

The browser tried to download mapserv.exe. The "exe" did actually
contain the GetCapabilities XML, but it is very annoying to have to
manually open it in another program each time.

This is a `FAQ on the MapServer
site <http://mapserver.org/faq.html#when-i-do-a-getcapabilities-why-does-my-browser-want-to-download-mapserv-exe-mapserv>`__
which suggested that a program needs to be manually associated with the
`MIME <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME>`__ type returned by the
requests - application/vnd.ogc.wms\_xml.

In FireFox I went about associating an application with the MIME type
application/vnd.ogc.wms\_xml, following the steps outlined
`here <http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Applications+panel?style_mode=inproduct>`__.
After a restart of FireFox nothing had changed.

I used `FireBug <http://getfirebug.com/>`__ to check that the request
was returning the correct MIME type. As shown in the image below the
server was correctly returning the correct Content-Type.

I then checked the request parameters sent from my browser to the
server. These included:

::

    Accept    text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language    en-US,en;q=0.7...
    Accept-Encoding    gzip,deflate

I then thought the reason for trying to download the content was due to
my browser not "accepting" the application/vnd.ogc.wms\_xml type. I used
another\ `FireFox
Add-In <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/967>`__ to modify
my request headers to accept the content type (and "chunked" encoding
just for good measure..).

The headers sent with my request now looked as follows:

::

    Accept    application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml,text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language    en-US,en;q=0.7,chrome://global/locale/intl.properties;q=0.3
    Accept-Encoding    chunked,gzip,deflate

A Hackish Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All good "fun" but I was still met with the same dialog box to download
the content. FireBug still reported the response data as *"The resource
from this URL is not text."*

 This
`post <http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapserver-users/2007-April/023264.html>`__
hints that the content type defined in the WMS specs was a mistake, and
that for the new WMS specifications the content type will be set to
text/html by default. It also suggested that adding a
&EXECPTIONS=text/html parameter to the request string could override the
content type, but this (I believe) is only where an exceptions actually
occur s on the server.

I stumbled across a solution by accident. While entering a request
string I put an incorrect version number in the VERSION parameter:

::

    http://geographika.azurewebsites.net/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/my.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.0.3&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

The response came back in an ``text/xml`` format that was displayed in
the browser! Whilst not very satisfactory, it was nicer than having to
manually open up fake .exe files. If anyone can shed any light on why
this is happening please let me know.

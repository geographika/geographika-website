What's New?

Welcome to the new web site! I have decided to move away from blog format to a more documentation-based approach. The plan is to write 
more detailed technical articles and talk links, and try and keep them up-to-date. 

I'm currently working on a new project `MapServer Studio <https://mapserverstudio.net/>`_ - an online application to work with Mapfiles
and dynamically render them with MapServer. Please subscribe by email or follow `@mapserverstudio <https://twitter.com/mapserverstudio>`_
to keep updated on development.

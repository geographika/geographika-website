Background
----------

As part of building and testing the SWIG generated MapScript bindings, I've been updating the 
`Building swig.exe using CMake <https://github.com/swig/swig/blob/master/Doc/Manual/Windows.html>`_ docs. 
See `Updated and tested Windows CMake build docs <https://github.com/swig/swig/pull/2169>`_ for recent updates.

Gathering dependencies on Windows always has its problems. `NuGet <https://www.nuget.org/>`_ - the package manager for .NET helps with this, especially
when trying to automate builds and reproduce them in CI processes. Nuget packages can be installed from the command-line, rather than trying to 
manually download files. 

Unfortunately often dependencies are not kept updated - the SWIG dependencies are as follows:

+ `CMake <https://www.nuget.org/packages/CMake-win64/>`_ - the latest version on Nuget is 3.15.5 which is fine
+ `Bison <https://www.nuget.org/packages/bison-win32/>`_ - only Bison 2 is available in this package, there is no Bison 3
+ `PCRE <https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre/>`_ - latest version is 8.33.0.1

SWIG itself is also available on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/swigwintools/

SWIG requires Bison3 to build without warnings - see `Build warnings on Windows when using Bison <3 <https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/2001>`_

Bison
-----

From the `Bison homepage <https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>`_:

    Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar 
    into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1) parser tables.

Bison is currently being maintained by Akim Demaille and Paul Eggert. A fork maintained by Akim Demaille is available at https://github.com/akimd/bison

A very useful project for Windows is `Win flex-bison <https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison>`_:

    Win flex-bison is a windows port the Flex (the fast lexical analyser) and Bison (GNU parser generator). 

This has ready-made exes for Bison at https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/
It also can be downloaded from Chocolatey at https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/winflexbison3

Initially the SWIG build steps used a combination of both NuGet and Chocolatey, but this was over-complicated, and my aim is to get
all dependencies using one package manager. 

From `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24662550/difference-between-chocolatey-and-nuget>`_:

    NuGet is designed to allow you to easily add code libraries to your project. Things like JSON.NET, Entity Framework, etc.

    Chocolatey is actually built on top of the NuGet package system, but it is designed to fill a different need. 
    Chocolatey wraps up applications and other executables and makes 
    it easy to install them on your computer. For example, tools like Git, Notepad++, etc. can be easily installed with a command like cinst git.

Bison likely falls into the latter category, but as above the aim is to use a single tool for all dependencies.


Building a Bison NuGet Package
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I followed the steps based on `this blog post <https://digitalhouseblog.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/how-to-make-a-nuget-package-for-c/>`_

Steps below:

+ Install Nuget from https://www.nuget.org/downloads (v6.0.0 was used, and installed to C:\Tools)

+ Clone the Bison GitHub project:

    .. code-block:: bat

        cd /D D:\GitHub\bison-nuget\source-projects
        git.exe clone --progress -v "https://github.com/akimd/bison" bison

+ Copy the doc files:

    .. code-block:: bat

        AUTHORS
        COPYING
        README

+ Get the exe file and rename to ``bison.exe``

    win_flex_bison3-latest\win_bison.exe

+ Create a nuspec file. See docs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec

+ Create the package:

    .. code-block:: bat

        cd /D D:\GitHub\bison-nuget\nuget
        C:\Tools\nuget pack bison.nuspec -OutputDirectory _builds

+ Check the contents of the generated ``Bison.3.7.4.nupkg`` by opening with 7-Zip. 

+ Test installing the package locally:

    .. code-block:: bat

        nuget sources add -name local-bison -source D:\GitHub\bison-nuget\nuget\_builds
        nuget sources
        C:\Tools\nuget install Bison -Version 3.7.4 -OutputDirectory C:\Tools\bison

+ Login to https://www.nuget.org/ (create a new MicroSoft account if necessary), and generate an API key. 

    .. code-block:: bat

        C:\Tools\nuget push _builds\*.nupkg -Source https://www.nuget.org/ -Apikey MY_API_KEY

Additional notes:

+ You can see the contents by clicking "Open in NuGet Package Explorer" https://nuget.info/packages/pcre/8.33.0.1
+ Make sure the package is tagged as a "Native package" - https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=tag%3Anative
+ The package contents was added as a repository to https://github.com/geographika/nuget-bison
+ Package is available on NuGet at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bison/

Building a PCRE2 Package
++++++++++++++++++++++++

`PCRE 8.33.0.1 <https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre/>`_ - is available on NuGet, however we want to build SWIG with
PCRE2. From https://www.pcre.org/:

    There are two major versions of the PCRE library. The current version, PCRE2, released in 2015, is now at version 10.39.

    The older, but still widely deployed PCRE library, originally released in 1997, is at version 8.45. This version of PCRE is now at end of life, and is no longer being actively maintained. 
    Version 8.45 is expected to be the final release of the older PCRE library, and new projects should use PCRE2 instead.

PCRE2 is available on GitHub at https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2. In the steps below w e will get the latest version at the time of writing (``pcre2-10.39``), and
compile the project using CMake:

+ Get the source and build the project:

  .. code-block:: bat
  
      cd C:\Tools
      SET PATH=C:\Tools\CMake\CMake-win64.3.15.5\bin;%PATH%
      git clone https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2.git
      cd pcre2
      git checkout tags/pcre2-10.39
      cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/Tools/pcre2 -S . -B build
      cmake --build build --config Release --target install

+ Now we can take these files and add them to a NuGet package:

  .. code-block:: bat
  
      SET OUTPUT_FOLDER=D:\GitHub\nuget-pcre2
      cd C:\Tools\pcre2
      copy AUTHORS %OUTPUT_FOLDER%
      copy LICENCE %OUTPUT_FOLDER%
      copy README.md %OUTPUT_FOLDER%
      xcopy C:\Tools\pcre2\build\Release %OUTPUT_FOLDER%\lib /E /I
      xcopy C:\Tools\pcre2\include %OUTPUT_FOLDER%\include /E /I
      xcopy C:\Tools\pcre2\doc\html %OUTPUT_FOLDER%\doc /E /I

+ Create a nuspec file. See docs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec

+ Create the package:

    .. code-block:: bat

        cd /D D:\GitHub\nuget-pcre2
        C:\Tools\nuget pack pcre2.nuspec -OutputDirectory _builds

+ Unsure if the following warning applies to C-builds, or .NET builds only?

  .. code-block:: bat

      WARNING: NU5101: The assembly 'lib\pcre2grep.exe' is placed directly under 'lib' folder. It is recommended that assemblies be placed inside a framework-specific folder. 
      Move it into a framework-specific folder.

+ Check the contents of the generated ``PCRE2.10.39.0.nupkg`` by opening with 7-Zip. 
+ Test installing the package locally:

    .. code-block:: bat

        nuget sources add -name local-pcre2 -source D:\GitHub\nuget-pcre2\_builds
        nuget sources
        C:\Tools\nuget install PCRE2 -Version 10.39 -OutputDirectory C:\Tools\pcre2

+ Push the package to https://www.nuget.org/

    .. code-block:: bat

        cd /D D:\GitHub\nuget-pcre2
        C:\Tools\nuget push _builds\*.nupkg -Source https://www.nuget.org/ -Apikey MY_API_KEY

Additional notes:

+ You can see the contents by clicking "Open in NuGet Package Explorer" https://nuget.info/packages/pcre2/10.39.0
+ The package contents was added as a repository to https://github.com/geographika/nuget-pcre2
+ Package is available on NuGet at https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre2/


..
    cd /D C:\Tools
    nuget install  pcre -Version 8.33.0.1 -OutputDirectory C:\Tools\pcre-nuget
